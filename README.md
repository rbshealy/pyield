# Pyield:
> A python package extending traditional boolean logic to new types of operations

## Motivation:

Wouldn't it be nice to have inverse functions of the typical operations we use on boolean variables?  
In Math, we often use inverse functions to undo the outputs of other functions.  
In my implementation of pyield, my goal is to be able to evaluate boolean variables using  
an extension of the already widely used operators (AND/OR) by introducing reverese functions as well as  
completely new ones (RSAND, RSOR, XPON). 

## Plans

Along with the package, I plan on outlining my methods of deriving these functions and their properties.
 
> I will intoduce three new types of boolean functions in this project:  
> 1. RSAND (reverse and) using the - operator
> 2. RSOR (reverse or) using the / operator
> 3. XPON (not final) using the ** operator

In explaining how these new types of logic operations work,
I plan to create and  provide logic gate implementations that can be recreated

>NOTE: This is an ongoing project. Expect things to be changed frequently.
